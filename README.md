# Arcade-Engine-Simulator
A program written in Python which simulates an engine. The engine's behaviour is defined on a lot of parameters. Program has a GUI panel and also generates sound.

Uses tkinter for GUI and updates in real time
Engine behaviour is simulated to be simple but realistic with multiple environmental factors to determine behaviour and performance
Sound generation depends on engine factors
Also has damage and wear simulation, thermal simulation, idle roughness, dynamic temperature, fuel and wear simulation

note: will work on adding more features such as power output (horsepower and torque)
